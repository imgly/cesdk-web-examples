Hey Mark

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,000
thanks for your time today.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,456
Let me quickly recap our chat.

00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:06,166
Our Video Editor SDK

5
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,776
for Web makes it

6
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,140
easy to create sales

7
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,233
or explainer videos.

8
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:11,166
it allows

9
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,776
you to design templates

10
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:15,166
make them sleek or

11
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,900
fun. The choice is yours.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,456
Templates come with placeholders, letting you

13
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:24,040
decide which elements users can tweak.

14
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,390
Then there's text variables to personalize videos, like

15
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,878
automatically adding your client's name like we did.

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,966
And yes, we made this video using our editor.
